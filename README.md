**Placement Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict whether a student will be placed based on their academic performance, demographic details, and extracurricular involvement. The objective is to use various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and determine the model with the highest accuracy.

**Dataset Details**

The dataset contains information about students, such as:

**Demographic Features**: Gender, age, etc.
**Academic Performance:** Scores in secondary, higher secondary, and degree examinations.
**Specialization:** Field of study (e.g., Science, Commerce, Arts, etc.).
**Work Experience:** Prior experience before applying for placements.
**Test Scores:** Scores in aptitude tests or technical skills assessments.
**Placement Status:** Whether the student got placed (binary target variable).
**Dataset Columns**
**Column Name	Description**

Gender	Gender of the student (Male/Female).
Age	Age of the student.
10th_Percentage	Marks obtained in 10th grade (in %).
12th_Percentage	Marks obtained in 12th grade (in %).
Degree_Percentage	Marks obtained in undergraduate degree (in %).
Specialization	Field of study in undergraduate degree.
Work_Experience	Work experience before placements (Yes/No).
Aptitude_Test_Score	Score in aptitude tests.
Placement_Status	Target variable: Placed (1) or Not Placed (0).
**Project Workflow**

1. Data Import and Preprocessing
Load the dataset using pandas.
Check for missing or null values and handle them.
Perform feature encoding for categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Work_Experience).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize feature distributions (e.g., histograms, box plots).
Analyze the relationship between features and the placement status.
Use a heatmap to observe correlations between features.
3. Feature Engineering
Select the most relevant features for the prediction task.
Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed.
4. Splitting Data
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
5. Model Training
Train the following classification models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate each model using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
7. Results Visualization
Compare the performance of all models using a bar chart for accuracy scores.
Display the Confusion Matrix for the best-performing model.
8. Final Model and Prediction
Use the best-performing model to make predictions on new/unseen data.
**Project Output**

The best-performing model is identified based on evaluation metrics.
Visualizations clearly showcase the performance of each algorithm and feature importance.
Predictions can guide decisions related to placements or improvements in student performance.
